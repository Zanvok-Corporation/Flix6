Flix Kernel
===========

Flix kernel - current 0xFD version is 6.22

The Flix kernel implements the core MS/PC-DOS (R) compatible functions.

Compiled kernels ready to use (just copy kernel.sys over an existing install)

This version of the kernel is intended only for 8086+ or 80386+ IBM compatible computers in continuation of the goals of the FreeDOS Project.  Please see http://www.fdos.org/kernel for my 0xDC kernel that is work on merging back in some of the original portability aspects and other supported features at the cost of some compatibility with older hardware/software.
